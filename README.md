# Python Card Games

A personal long-term project that will include a variety of different card games. It will (hopefully) have a clean interface, and two player hot-seat functionality.

### Goals

- Get better at coding in general
- Improve at game development
  - Hopefully get faster and more efficient at coding games
- After project completion, I hope to translate it over to mobile
- Have fun
